# Some Code
Throwing together some code that I use pretty often at work, so I dont have to keep finding it and copy/pasting it repeatedly.

## Why???
### Motivation
Very often in day to day work I find myself re-writing the same code again and again, so I thought I'll start making my own scripts where I can just store code and copy/paste when needed. Even this became an issue when I had lots of code saved as a giant string in a txt file, and finding snippets or figuring out what I was thinking back then to write it so badly was a pain. So here is an effort to formally write down the code I use in a easy to use, robust and clean way. Best of all, its tailored to me, so the way the code works and the results I get are just how I like it.

### Examples

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- Matplotlib
- Numpy 1.1.7+
- Pandas
- Scipy

All requirements are in `requirements.txt`, should be easy to install from there I hope.

## Documentation
Documentation is provided <a, href="">here</a>. Its still growing, I hope I'll be able to maintain it well...

## Contributing
Feel free to suggest any issues or improvements, but keep in mind the only reason I'm putting this here is just version control really. Public because maybe someone can use something one day. Please do suggest improvements but remember the code is made in my style, designed for use how I like it.
